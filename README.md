DúiToken - 3% to LP, 3% Distributed, 3T supply

## $DÚINOMICS

Made for an eternal PUMP.

$DÚI tokenomics are based on 4 main strengths:
    . EARNINGS FOR GOOD OWNERS
    . Scarcity and rarity
    . Price empowerment
    . Fair transactions

Each transaction of $DÚI generates Passive Income to the holders.
3% of all transactions (transfers, buys and sells) go back to the holders, and the size of your REWARD is proportional to the size of your bag. 
That is: The more you hold, the more you earn.

3% of all transactions are automatically sent to the liquidity pool to ensure more sustainable prices & liquidity moving forward. (/Encourage higher bottoms & tops)

The Total Supply is 3,000,000,000,000 $DUI.
Transactions are limited to 0.5% of the total supply. (15B/3T tokens)
