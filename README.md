# DuiToken

DúiToken - 8% Holder Rewards, 3T supply (>10% burned, progressive burn)

## $DÚINOMICS

Made for an eternal PUMP.

$DÚI tokenomics are based on 4 main strengths:
    . EARNINGS FOR GOOD OWNERS
    . Scarcity and rarity
    . Price empowerment
    . Fair transactions

Each transaction of $DÚI generates Passive Income to the holders.
8% of all transactions (transfers, buys and sells) go back to the holders, and the size of your REWARD is proportional to the size of your bag. 
That is: The more you hold, the more you earn.

A portion of all reward transactions are automatically sent to the liquidity wallet (which is also a holder @ 2.4*%) to ensure more sustainable prices & liquidity moving forward. (/Encourage higher bottoms & tops)

The Total Supply is 3,000,000,000,000 $DUI.
Transactions are limited to 1% of the total supply. (30B/3T tokens)
Currently there is over 349bil/3000bil DUI burned. $DUI has a deflationary, progressively increasing burn via the [BSC burn wallet](https://bscscan.com/token/0x8943b6d1677a4addbe5aa58f429e11e856746fba?a=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001).

### Contract & Audit 
All logic for $DUI is built within the genesis smart contract ```DuiToken.sol``` the only external interaction in our code is with the PancakeSwap V2 Router / LP.

The TechRate Audit details can be found [in the repo here](https://github.com/DuiToken/DuiToken/tree/master/audit).
